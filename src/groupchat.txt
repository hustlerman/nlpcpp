Kristen Lovell
Over by the library on the field? I think just a big walkway
Sam Rappl
I think it's eb4 and 5
Katie Hazel
more engineering buildings? dang
Kristen Lovell
They gotta make space for industrial I think
That will eventually go next to the lib
Sam Rappl
I think they're planning to have all engineering on centennial by 2021
Kristen Lovell
Woah that‚Äôs soon
Sam Rappl
That year was totally out of my butt
Kristen Lovell
Oh okay lol
Sam Rappl
But i may have heard that
Katie Hazel
LMFAO u be lying for no reason
Sam Rappl
It kinda just popped into my head so no idea if it's legit or not
The oval is supposed to be finished by 2021, but no word when all the engineerings are gonna be on centennial
Nick Latz
Nuclear is never going to move over but the rest of the disciplines should be in EB Oval
Kristen Lovell
Yea you can‚Äôt move a nuclear reactor lol

Angela Hoyt
Hey so looking at the song list there arnt a lot of throw back or classic songs that everyone knows (like rockin robin, toxic etc) are there any that you guys can think of? and just put in the chat so we can maybe sing them tonight. I'm having trouble coming up with some so if you cant its ok
Kristen Lovell
Do you mean songs Wolfgang has done in the past or just older songs in general?
Angela Hoyt
Older sonvs in general
Fun songs people can recognize
Kristen Lovell
üëç
Megan Hood
I suggested several! Oh darn are y'all doing solo audition stuff tonight?
Angela Hoyt
Sorry its kinda all thrown together but yeah thats what I wanted to do while Chris and Chloe review music and we have a small room
But I also wanted to set aside time for everyone to practice and talk about songs before we start singing
I know this isnt ideal but if we can start arranging at least one song that would be nice
Megan Hood
Erm is there any way that I could also audition despite the fact that I am in the galapagos? Like maybe when I gey back? Or I could be a hermit tonight and try to record stuff I guess but the internet sucks not sure if I would even be able to send anyway.
Angela Hoyt
When do you get back?
Megan Hood
Supposed to get back Sunday around noon. I'm pretty sure I will be exhausted because we will be taking a red eye flight out of Ecuador, but I can make it work.
I will try to think of some oldies but goodies and throw them up there. About to go snorkeling though so woohoo!
Angela Hoyt
Have fun!

Katie Hazel

But I am also,sunburned, covered in bug bites, multiple,big bruises, sat on a poison apple and got a giant welp, scraped both knees, and am utterly exhausted and no air conditioning and only cold,shower. But its so awesome! Best trip ever!!!!!!! You guys should put this in your bucket list!!!!!
Ryan Gramzay
I'm glad you're having a good time!!!
Sam Rappl
The way you describe it doesn't really make it sound like it's a good bucket list trip.... unless it's last on your bucket list
but I'm glad you're having fun ‚ù§Ô∏è
Megan Hood
Its awesome bc I've seen gisnt tortoises, sea turtles, blue footed boobies, iguanas, flamingos, sea lions, all the tropical fish and cool birds and orcas and sharks. Then we hiked to a volcano today that is active. And the food is awesome. And Darwin!

Crap I almost got into some trouble.... Jeremy you know how I gave you that parking pass? Bc I'm a cripple I just tried to get a vet school pass and the parking lady was like you already have a pass and in like no I don't and she was like what do you mean. And I had to backtrack like hell. She was totally onto me. And then she interrogated me asking if I was parking in the Dan Allen deck. Dude I was sweating.
Jeremy Kelly
Ahhhhhh
What ended up happening???
Megan Hood
I just bull shitted along and she was like ok get your extra pass this afternoon and hung up. But I dont know man. I really don't want to be in crutches from the fairgrounds to the vet school - like I need that pass. But I'm a terrible liar. Hopefully they dont make a big deal,about it this afternoon.
Jeremy Kelly
Wait so were you just getting a temporary pass??
Megan Hood
Yeah.
Oh FUCK. She said they need to know my license plate number. But they will see your number on the record. Will the pass even work then? I dont think so. I think this means I cant get a pass. üòì
Jeremy Kelly
Is it not allowed to have two passes?
Like drive two cars?
Megan Hood
Not sure. It sounds improbable.
Jeremy Kelly
Oh no :( is there any way I could try and get a pass from my account for you?
Or maybe someone in the vet school who doesn‚Äôt have a pass?
Megan Hood
I dont know. Ill talk to my roommate and she if she would be willing to get a pass. Hopefully that will work. Gah!
Jeremy Kelly
I‚Äôm sorry Megan :( lmk if there‚Äôs anything I can do to help! I don‚Äôt want ya to be running around on crutches all day long :/

Omg transportation is the worst. First I get there as fast as I can after class, which was around 4:30. I'm the only one in the office and the two,women working there look sooooooo busy NOT. They see me and are like 'oh youre the one wanting the temporary pass. Our boss who handeled that left at 3.' I say 'I know she did. She told me that you guys could,help me.' They say 'Oh ok! In order to get the pass you have to turn in your Dan Allen pass.' And I say 'I cant do that.' And they say 'Well you can come back in tomorrow and talk to our boss if you want.' And they look pissed off that I'm there. I seriouy am a person on crutches and I know I look like,shit bc I'm exhausted and my armpits are bruised already. And they can't even let me park for a week?! My roommate is there and I ask if she can get the pass and they are like 'No only our boss handles that.' But they were able to potentially get me one so that makes no fucking sense?! I cant stand it - I'm just so angry! üò°
Brendan Micciche
Bureaucracy sucks. I can't tell you how many times I've impotently raged at red tape and incompetence like that. Needless to say, I'm a little angry now too just reading about that.

Ummmm intro to sociology is pretty easy
Brendan Micciche
Depends on your temperament and interests. It'll be harder if you really don't care.
Sierra LaPlante
Sw 201 but you have to do some volunteering
With Dr. Hall. We barely did anything
Ryan Gramzay
Sociology teachers are usually pretty chill and cool and the material is easy to understand
Angela Hoyt
That's what I'm about
Brendan Micciche
I agree with Ryan. Though intro psych courses aren't too hard either. Not from my experience anyhow.
Sierra LaPlante
True. Also true for social work

Ok dope ill look at those, there's a history class about the mysteries and frauds in archeology that sounds cool

any easy history or lit classes?
Sierra LaPlante
History classes always have a lot of reading in my experience
Chris B
Great works of Western lit was pretty easy but I love reading and writing so there's that
Brendan Micciche
As a writer but not a great reader, those classes are difficult for me. Enlightening, inspiring, and very necessary for intellectual development...but still hard lol.
Katie Hazel
Psych 311 with Dr. Nacoste for sureee. You would love it! It's hard to get into tho.
It's so easy but also very interesting
Sierra LaPlante
I really enjoyed social psychology. Is that 311?
Katie Hazel
Yes! i think there's 2 professors but nacoste is superior in every way
Sierra LaPlante
I would straight up take that class twice
Mainly because I missed so many lectures bc it was at 8:30 am but most interesting class for me other than archery
Katie Hazel
RIGHT?! I'm gonna be his TA next semester because I want to relive itüòÇ
Sierra LaPlante
Ang take that one
Whaaaat?!?!
Dope af
Kristen Lovell
I thought psych classes counted towards the social science requirement and not as a humanities course?
Sierra LaPlante
CHASS
Kristen Lovell
If that‚Äôs not the case though I would much rather take psych than history next year lol.
Sierra LaPlante
College of humanities and social sciences
Kristen Lovell
Oh I meant for like GEP requirements
You have to take 2 humanities and 2 social sciences or something like that
Megan Hood
Definitely choose something you think sounds fun. If its a history or lit class that bores you it becomes impossible to stay ahead. I took a lit class called 'monsters and mystery' or something like that that was fun. And a ethics and gender class that was entertaining. Both gave me honors credit too so got 2 birds with one stone.
Megan Hood
Western traffic is killing me today. -_-
